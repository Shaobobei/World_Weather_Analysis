# World_Weather_Analysis
## Jack wanted to kickoff a fun new project on world weather; a PlanMyTrip app.
With any new product, the beta tester recommended us to make a few changes for a better experience while using the app. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data and have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
